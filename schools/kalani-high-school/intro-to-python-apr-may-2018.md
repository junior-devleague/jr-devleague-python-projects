### Class Recap 4/9/18
Format of class was as follows:
- What is computer programming?
  - A computer program is a set of instructions that causes a computer to perform tasks
  - Itâ€™s a set of commands that tell the computer what to do
  - Software is a collection of computer programs
- Fundamentals of Computer Programming
  - Syntax
  - Data
  - Control Flow
  - Functions
- Intro to Python Variables
  - What is a variable?
  - In programming, variables describe a place to store information.
  - You can store numbers, text, and lists of numbers and text
- Whiteboard Examples
- Variables & Data Types Live Code
- Naming conventions
  - Variable names can include numbers or letters, but should always start with a letter
  - Python uses snake case for separating each word using underscores
    - Example: `treasure_chest = 'gold'`
- Datatypes
  - Text
    - The text data type can be identified by quotation marks
    - Text should be wrapped in either single or double quotes
    - Numbers wrapped in quotes are still text
  - Integeres
    - Integers are written without quotes
    - Integers can be whole, negative, or include decimals but NOT commas
  - List
    - Lists are contained within square brackets
    - Each item should be separated by a comma
    - Lists can contain text, numbers, and other lists
  - Displaying values on a console or terminal with print()
    - print() gives us immediate feedback on our code
    - We can easily see the values of our variables with print()
- Math operators
  - Add +, Subtract - , Multiply * , Divide /
  - Order of operation rules still apply in programming where multiplication and division will be executed before addition and subtraction.
  - To control the order of operations we wrap our calculation in parenthesis.
```Example:
5  + 30 * 20 = 605
(5 + 30) * 20 = 700
```
